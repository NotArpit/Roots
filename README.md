# Roots

What is Roots?

We are a peer-to-peer based application with the primary goal of minimising food wastage
within urban cities, restuarants, supermarkets and any general food providers on a daily basis
waste tonnes of food simply because it is unfit for sale but not at all unfit for consumption.

#How do we solve this issue?

Roots aims to alleviate the "middle-man" in the purchasing of food ingredients, for example, consider
a restaurant that is forced to through away perfectly edible ingredients simply because by tomorrow it
will no longer be fit for cooking purposes. Through our application, a local restaurant can place a listing
for these ingredients to be sold at a below-market price, so they are incentivised to sell the food ingredients,
and consumers can consequentially purchase ingredients at a below-market price, so they are incentivised to 
buy soon-to-expire ingredients at the expense of cheap costs.
