# What is Roots?

We are a peer-to-peer based application with the primary goal of minimising food wastage within urban cities. 
Food providers such as restuarants and supermarkets waste tonnes of food every day simply because it is unfit 
for sale but not at all unfit for consumption.

# How do we solve this issue?

Roots aims to alleviate the "middle-man" in the purchasing of food ingredients, for example, consider
a restaurant that is forced to throw away perfectly edible ingredients simply because by tomorrow it
will no longer be fit for cooking purposes. Through our application, a local restaurant can place a listing
for these ingredients to be sold at a below-market price, so they are incentivised to sell the food ingredients,
and consumers can consequentially purchase ingredients at a below-market price, so they are incentivised to 
buy soon-to-expire ingredients at the expense of cheap costs.
